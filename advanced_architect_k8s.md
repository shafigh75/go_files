You're asking a **key architectural question** for deploying Kubernetes in an enterprise-level private cloud setup using **Proxmox VMs**, and you're looking to scale, secure, and optimize your infrastructure.

Let’s break this down with **enterprise best practices**, including how to handle:

- Load balancing
- Ingress
- CDN integration
- Routing
- HA (High Availability)
- Scalability

---

# 🧱 Your Setup Recap

- You’re running **Kubernetes on Proxmox VMs**
- VMs are part of a **K8s cluster**
- You want **enterprise-grade architecture**
- You're considering options like:
  - Using `LoadBalancer` services inside K8s
  - Using MikroTik or Ubuntu as router/load balancer
  - Integrating with a **CDN**

---

# ✅ Enterprise-Grade Architecture Best Practices

Here's the recommended **layered architecture** for production use:

```
[Client] → [CDN (Cloudflare, Akamai)] 
           ↓
        [Firewall / Router (MikroTik or Ubuntu)] 
           ↓
     [HAProxy / Keepalived (External LB)]
           ↓
       [Kubernetes Cluster (Proxmox VMs)]
           ↳ MetalLB + Cilium Ingress or NGINX Ingress
```

Each layer has a specific purpose and improves scalability, security, and manageability.

---

## 🔐 Layer 1: CDN Integration (e.g., Cloudflare)

### Why?
- Offloads traffic from your cluster
- Mitigates DDoS attacks
- Caches static content
- Provides global edge network

### How?
- Point your domain DNS to the CDN provider (e.g., Cloudflare)
- Set origin to your **external load balancer IP(s)**

> ✅ This is optional but **highly recommended** for public-facing apps.

---

## 🛡️ Layer 2: Firewall / Router (MikroTik or Ubuntu)

### Option A: MikroTik (RouterOS)

**Pros:**
- Powerful networking features
- Easy UI for firewall rules, NAT, VLANs
- Stable and widely used in enterprise networks

**Use Cases:**
- Basic routing
- NAT for internal IPs
- Simple firewalling
- BGP support if needed

**Cons:**
- Less flexible for advanced load balancing
- Not ideal for TLS termination or dynamic routing

### Option B: Ubuntu with `iptables`, `keepalived`, `bird`, etc.

**Pros:**
- Full Linux flexibility
- Can run HAProxy, BGP daemons, firewalls
- Easier to automate and integrate with CI/CD

**Use Cases:**
- Running HAProxy or Envoy as external LB
- BGP peering with MetalLB (for scalable LB)
- Custom scripting and monitoring

**Cons:**
- Requires more sysadmin knowledge
- More moving parts than MikroTik

> ✅ **Recommended for full control and enterprise scaling.**

---

## ⚙️ Layer 3: External Load Balancer (HAProxy + Keepalived)

### Why Use HAProxy?

- High-performance TCP/HTTP proxy
- Supports health checks, SSL termination, path-based routing
- Works well with MetalLB behind it
- Easily integrated with Let's Encrypt (via certbot)

### Why Keepalived?

- Adds high availability to HAProxy
- Enables floating IP between multiple HAProxy nodes
- Prevents single point of failure

### Example Setup

```text
haproxy01 (IP: 192.168.1.10) ─┐
                              ├─ VIP: 192.168.1.100
haproxy02 (IP: 192.168.1.11) ─┘
                                 ↓
                          Kubernetes Nodes (Proxmox VMs)
```

All external traffic hits the VIP (`192.168.1.100`) and is distributed across HAProxy nodes.

---

## 🧱 Layer 4: Kubernetes Cluster on Proxmox VMs

### Recommended Stack:

| Component | Tool | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| CNI | **Cilium** | eBPF-based, fast, supports native ingress |
| Ingress Controller | **Cilium Ingress** or **NGINX Ingress** | Choose based on needs |
| LoadBalancer Support | **MetalLB** | For bare metal LB support |
| Monitoring | Prometheus + Grafana | From kube-prometheus-stack |
| Logging | Loki + Promtail | Lightweight log aggregation |
| Service Mesh | Istio or Linkerd | Optional for advanced microservices |

---

## 📦 Sample Network Layout

```
VM Node 1: 192.168.1.21 – Control Plane + Worker
VM Node 2: 192.168.1.22 – Worker
VM Node 3: 192.168.1.23 – Worker

External LB: haproxy01/haproxy02 → Floating IP: 192.168.1.100
MetalLB Pool: 192.168.1.200–192.168.1.250
Ingress Service: nginx-lb → EXTERNAL-IP: 192.168.1.200
```

---

## 🧩 Deployment Options

### Option A: Use MetalLB Only

- Fast to set up
- Good for small clusters
- Limited to Layer2 or BGP mode
- No TLS offloading

### Option B: MetalLB + HAProxy Ingress

- HAProxy handles TLS, routing, health checks
- MetalLB used internally (optional)
- Better control over traffic before hitting Kubernetes

### Option C: MetalLB + Cilium Ingress + HAProxy

- Most flexible
- HAProxy handles public TLS & routing
- Cilium handles internal service mesh and ingress
- Great for large-scale deployments

---

## 🧪 Example Use Case: Public Web App

```
https://myapp.example.com
   ↓
Cloudflare CDN
   ↓
MikroTik or Ubuntu Router
   ↓
HAProxy (TLS Termination)
   ↓
Cilium Ingress (Host/path routing)
   ↓
Kubernetes Pod (App)
```

This gives you:
- Edge caching (CDN)
- Security (firewall/router)
- High availability (HAProxy + Keepalived)
- Advanced routing (Cilium Ingress)
- Internal networking (Cilium CNI)

Let’s break down your two main concerns in the context of the **optimal production-grade architecture**:

---

# 🔍 Question 1: Doesn't the router/firewall become a SPOF?

### ✅ Short Answer:
Yes — if you use a **single router/firewall**, it **does become a SPOF**. But in enterprise setups, we avoid this by using **active/passive or active/active redundancy**.

---

## 🧱 Enterprise Best Practice: Avoid SPOF with Redundant Routers

There are several ways to eliminate the router as a SPOF:

---

### ✅ Option A: Use Two MikroTik Routers in Active/Passive Mode

- Use **VRRP** to assign a **virtual IP (VIP)**
- One node is active, one passive
- If the active fails, VRRP failover happens automatically

#### Example:
```text
MikroTik 1 – IP: 192.168.1.1
MikroTik 2 – IP: 192.168.1.2
Virtual IP (VIP): 192.168.1.254
```

All downstream devices route through `192.168.1.254`.

---

### ✅ Option B: Ubuntu Router + Keepalived (Highly Recommended)

Use two Ubuntu machines running:
- `keepalived` for VIP management
- `iptables` or `nftables` for firewall
- Optional: `bird` or `frr` for BGP peering

#### Example:
```text
Ubuntu-Rtr1 – IP: 192.168.1.10
Ubuntu-Rtr2 – IP: 192.168.1.11
Virtual IP: 192.168.1.254
```

Keepalived ensures that only one machine owns the VIP at a time.

> This is flexible, scriptable, and integrates well with automation tools like Ansible.

---

### ✅ Option C: Use Cloud Native LB + BGP (for large scale)

If you're managing hundreds of nodes:
- Use **BGP routers** (like Cumulus Linux, VyOS, or FRR)
- Integrate with **MetalLB in BGP mode**
- Let your routers dynamically learn routes from Kubernetes nodes

This is more advanced but allows full **scalability and HA** without central load balancers.

---

## ✅ Summary: How to Avoid SPOF in Router Layer

| Strategy | Tools | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| VRRP | MikroTik, Cisco, VyOS | Simple HA for small clusters |
| Keepalived | Ubuntu/CentOS | More control, better integration |
| BGP Peering | MetalLB + FRR/BIRD | For large-scale, automated routing |

---

# 📡 Question 2: When a request hits HAProxy, what address should be used as the upstream server?

You’re asking about **how HAProxy forwards traffic into the Kubernetes cluster**.

Let’s clarify the roles first:

---

## 🧠 HAProxy Role

HAProxy acts as the **external-facing reverse proxy/load balancer**. It terminates TLS, does path-based routing, and forwards traffic to:

- The **Kubernetes Ingress controller**, or
- Directly to **node IPs** where services are exposed

---

## ✅ Best Practice: Upstream Should Point to Ingress Controller

So, when HAProxy receives a request, it should forward it to the **Ingress controller**, not directly to the API server or pods.

Here’s how it works:

```
Client → HAProxy (TLS Termination) → [Cilium Ingress / NGINX Ingress] → Pod
```

### Why not point to API Server?
Because:
- The API server is for **control plane operations**, not data plane traffic.
- Services/pods are accessed via **kube-proxy**, **NodePort**, or **LoadBalancer**.

---

## 🧱 So What Is the Correct Upstream Address?

### Option A: Use Node IPs + NodePort

If your Ingress controller is deployed as a DaemonSet (e.g., Cilium Ingress):

```haproxy
backend k8s_ingress_http
    balance uri
    server node1 192.168.1.21:30432 check
    server node2 192.168.1.22:30432 check
    server node3 192.168.1.23:30432 check
```

Where:
- `30432` is the **NodePort** assigned to your Ingress service.

### Option B: Use LoadBalancer IP (via MetalLB)

If you’ve configured a service of type `LoadBalancer` for Ingress:

```bash
kubectl get svc -n kube-system cilium-ingress
```

Output:
```
NAME              TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP      PORT(S)
cilium-ingress    LoadBalancer   10.96.120.10   203.0.113.10     80:30432/TCP
```

Then configure HAProxy like this:

```haproxy
backend k8s_ingress_http
    server ingress_lb 203.0.113.10:80 check
```

This way, HAProxy sends traffic to the **MetalLB-assigned VIP**, which is then routed inside Kubernetes.

> ⚠️ Make sure the MetalLB VIP is reachable from HAProxy (i.e., same network or routed properly).

---

## ✅ Summary: HAProxy Upstream Options

| Upstream Target | Description | Pros | Cons |
|------------------|-------------|------|------|
| Node IPs + NodePort | Most reliable for bare metal | Works everywhere | Requires multiple backend entries |
| LoadBalancer IP (MetalLB) | Easier to manage | Single endpoint | Depends on MetalLB working correctly |
| IngressController Service DNS | e.g., `cilium-ingress.kube-system.svc.cluster.local` | Clean internal routing | Not routable from outside cluster |

---

# 🧩 Final Architecture Recap

```
[Client] → [CDN (Cloudflare)] 
          ↓
       [Firewall/Router (Keepalived + Ubuntu)]
          ↓
        [HAProxy (TLS, Routing)]
          ↓
        [Kubernetes Ingress (Cilium Ingress)]
          ↓
        [Kubernetes Service → Pod]
```

- HAProxy forwards to **Ingress controller** (not API server)
- Ingress controller routes to appropriate service based on host/path
- MetalLB assigns public IPs to services
- Multiple routers ensure no SPOF

---

# ✅ Final Checklist

| Task | Status |
|------|--------|
| ✅ Router/Firewall has HA (Keepalived/VRRP) | ✔️ |
| ✅ HAProxy uses Ingress controller as upstream | ✔️ |
| ✅ Ingress controller is highly available across nodes | ✔️ |
| ✅ MetalLB provides external IPs | ✔️ |
| ✅ TLS handled at HAProxy layer | ✔️ |
| ✅ CDN used (optional but recommended) | ✔️ |
