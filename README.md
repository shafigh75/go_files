# go_files
these are sample go files and some more tools that i worked with

### TODOS for my IMDG:
- add persistance and use a decent serialization method
- add WAL log
- add a config for the db
- add authentication
- add high availability and clustering capabilities
- add cli
- add bash script to setup the tooling
- separate server and cli and use service to manage server
